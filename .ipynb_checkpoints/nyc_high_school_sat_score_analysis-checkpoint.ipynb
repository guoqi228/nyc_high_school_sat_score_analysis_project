    "#### One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",

    " - Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools\n",

    " - New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools\n",

    "- Both the percentage of females (female_per) and number of females (female_num) at a school correlate positively with SAT score, whereas the percentage of males (male_per) and the number of males (male_num) correlate negatively. This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",

    "- Student ratings of school academic standards (aca_s_11) correlate with sat_score, but this does not hold for ratings from teachers and parents (aca_p_11 and aca_t_11).\n",
    "- There is significant racial inequality in SAT scores (white_per, asian_per, black_per, hispanic_per).\n",
    "- The percentage of English language learners at the school (ell_percent, frl_percent) has a strong negative correlation with SAT scores.\n",

    "#### We can plot columns in a dataframe using the pandas.DataFrame.plot() accessor on a dataframe. We can also specify a certain plot type. For example, df.plot.scatter(x=\"A\", y=\"b\") will create a scatterplot of columns A and B."

It looks like uptown Manhattan and parts of Queens have a higher ell_percent, but we can't be sure. One way to make very granular statistics easier to read is to aggregate them. In this case, we can aggregate by district, which will enable us to plot ell_percent district-by-district instead of school-by-school.\n",
